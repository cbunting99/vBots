# how to install
- download and rename folder name to vbots

  final path would like yourwowfolder/Interface/Addon/vbots
- enable it from lower left corner the login screen

- for bots premade gear and spec, please select bots, and click the question mark to retrive the available gear/spec, then click the number to apply the gear/spec set


# other notice
- Notice, you have to be GM level 6 to use all commands
- I'm not good at addon, i just added 32 buttons for each, if you know there is a better way to set the gear/spec template welcome to make PR

- To make an account a gm with the right permission level, type this in the mangosd console:

account set gmlevel <name> 6

so it would look like below

account set gmlevel test1 6
